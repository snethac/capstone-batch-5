Data for DVD rental analysis is taken from postgress sql.

This data contains information about customers who have rented the films, customer information like name address, categories of films, languages of films, rental information, film information, stores information, actors iformation, and payment details.

Master table is created to get the required amount of datafrom overall data by running a sql query by joining all the required tables.

After creating the master table EDA is done in python.

using the data in Master table dashboards are created in Tableau for our problem statements.

 ## Descriptions of dashboards and worksheets

 simillarly most rented film analysis is done based on film rating, and montly rentals of films.

 # EDA Outputs

 Rental duration is uniformly distributed

 Amount paid by customers and if we look closely at the data we can see that a lot of data points are distributed uniformly.

 There are 183 null values in the data after creating master table those null values are beacuse of customers not returning the rental

 # Insights and Recommendation
 #### Rental Analysis
 ***
 We can apply some penalty/late fee forthose who return late.

We can make rent price slab according to number of days or hours of rent duration.

#### Top 10 customer
***
Give them gift cards , special discounts, gift hampers & certificate of appreciation.

Upload their pics with name and positive reviews on sites.

#### Country wise sales revenue (MAP)
***

Focus on those countries where service is not available.

Focus on those countries that have large population but not generate a good amount of revenue, so more advertise will be good for increase revenue.
